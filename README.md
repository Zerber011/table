The table you can fine at this link : https://zerber011.github.io/table_demo/

In order to position table in viewport, I use 'display - flex' at 'body' 
and than 'justify-content: center' to position elements.

In order to define the width of the columns, I put a width of 25% in the header of table, 
and all other columns are followed.
